# YourTravelGuide Content Guidelines

Use this checklist for every new rule page to keep AdSense, SEO, and user trust intact. Keep the tone friendly and helpful—write as if you are prepping a friend for their flight.

## 1. 100% Original Voice
- Never copy from DGCA/BCAS/airline PDFs or news sites.
- No line-by-line rewrites; explain concepts in your own words.
- Add context, stories, or examples (e.g., “a 20,000mAh power bank fits under the 100Wh limit”).

## 2. Add Real Value
Include at least one of the following per section:
- ✅ Examples or scenarios
- ✅ Checklists or do/don’t tables
- ✅ Common mistakes + fixes
- ✅ Quick tips for Indian travelers

## 3. E-A-T Block (Footer)
Every page must end with:
```
India DGCA guidelines — simplified
Verified on: DD MMM YYYY
Official source: <link>
Disclaimer: Rules change often; confirm with your airline and airport.
```
Update the date whenever the page is refreshed.

## 4. Word Count & Structure (600–1200 words)
- Quick answer paragraph at the top.
- Use H2/H3 headings, bullet lists, emojis or icons.
- Add a “Tips” section and an FAQ (minimum 3 Q&As).
- Tables are encouraged when comparing cabin vs checked rules.

## 5. Safety-First Messaging
- Never suggest loopholes or tricks.
- Do not recommend hiding items or arguing with staff.
- Always direct readers to follow CISF, DGCA, and airline instructions.

## 6. Multi-Format Content
Each page must mix:
- Paragraphs + bullet lists
- Headings + subheadings
- Emojis/icons for callouts
- Tables where it clarifies limits

## 7. Internal Links
Add 3–4 contextual links to other YourTravelGuide pages (e.g., perfume page → liquids rule, razor rule, baby milk rule).

## 8. Keyword Usage
Work relevant phrases naturally into copy:
- “Allowed in flight India”
- “Cabin or check-in baggage?”
- “DGCA rules for battery”
- “Can I carry __ in flight?”
Avoid stuffing—use them where they fit.

## 9. Mobile UX Awareness
While writing, assume mobile readers:
- Short paragraphs (2–3 sentences)
- Clear subheadings
- Buttons/filters must remain tap-friendly (handled in UI but keep copy concise).
